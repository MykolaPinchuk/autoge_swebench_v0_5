## This is an early POC for project to build Dynamic Evolutionary Multi-Agent Systems (DEMAS)

This POC tests basic building blocks for DEMAS: setting up multiple agents and evaluating their performance for agentic coding on few problems from SWE-bench.

It is simplistic and minimalistic on purpose. Its objective is to validate that building blocks for DEMAS are possible to build and run efficiently.
